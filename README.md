### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ **busy** w/ [Web Words](https://github.com/SubZtep/web-words) browser add-on:
  - Me, the only potential user getting contented with its stability.
  - As a side effect, I started to memorise my ludicrous word list!
    - Want for :fire::fox_face: mobile too but have to rewrite the dictionary sync on account of the ridiculous **102400 bytes** synced storage size.
  - Hopefully 1-2 weeks and I can move on. :snail::dancers:
  - Already found the :zap: [Chrome bug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBuz8XjvEAw).
  - Just as boring as I made an ~~overdesigned~~ [TS boilerplate](https://github.com/SubZtep/typescript-boilerplate) to start a website. :hurtrealbad:
- :seedling: after :grey_question: my long time untouched [**Blender** tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-blender-3d-modeling-for-unity-video-game-development/) suddenly become up2date and finally slightly rationale link to more [**3D** assignments](http://15462.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2020/) B4 focus on [**#4o4**](https://github.com/SubZtep/a-4o4) can't wait **(à¹‘Ëƒá´—Ë‚)ï»­**
- :mailbox_closed: update l8r :crocodile:
